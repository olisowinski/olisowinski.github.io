            <h1>Earlier Years & <span>Education</span></h1>
            <p class="para1">My passion for IT has deep roots that go back to my childhood. It all started with gaming, thanks to my dad, who’s been an avid gamer since the 90s. Watching him play and eventually joining him, I naturally developed an interest in video games. What began as simple play quickly grew into a curiosity about how these games were made and what powered them. I loved playing with my dad and friends, but it wasn't until I was around 15 years old that I started to take the technical side of things more seriously, diving into the world of computer hardware.<br></p>
            <p class="para2">At 17, I decided to take things a step further and built my very first PC from scratch. Although I was a beginner, the process of configuring the system taught me a lot about the inner workings of electronics—how each component fits together to form a fully functional machine. This hands-on experience sparked a deeper fascination with hardware and how it drives everything in the tech world.<br></p>
            <p class="para3">I was eager to formally pursue my interest in technology, my high school didn’t offer a Computer Science program, which was a bit of a setback. But I didn’t let that stop me. I kept learning on my own, developing skills and gaining experience through personal projects, and stayed focused on my goal of studying Computer Science at the university level. My persistence and passion eventually paid off, and I’m now on the path to turning my childhood interest into a professional career in IT.<br></p>
            <h2>Personal Information </h2>
            <p class="para4">One of my greatest loves is skiing. I’m an avid skier, and winter is by far my favourite season. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of being on a pristine white mountain, gliding down the slopes with a pair of skis and sunglasses. It’s a sense of freedom and adventure that I crave every winter.<br></p>
            <p class="para5">Staying active is a huge part of my life. I’ve been playing basketball since my early school years, even competing in the Polish National Basketball Championship in middle school. Over the years, I’ve expanded my sports interests to include football, volleyball, and martial arts. I’ve trained in boxing, kickboxing, and MMA, and I love the discipline and mental focus these sports require.<br></p>
            <p class="para6">I also enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it’s taking a leisurely stroll in nature, hiking through scenic landscapes, or engaging in any other outdoor activity. Being in nature is something I find incredibly refreshing and grounding.<br></p>
            <p class="para7">On weekends, I make time to support my favourite Formula 1 team and drivers, always keeping up with the latest races. Additionally, I stay active in my community by participating in volunteer work, which allows me to give back and make a positive impact on those around me.<br></p>
